# Man-Chmod-Command
Objective:

Use the chmod system call to write your own version of the chmod command
The program should accept two command-line arguments, the name of a file, and the octal value for setting the permissions for the file.
The program should display an appropriate message if the file does not exist, or the command is invoked with the wrong number of arguments.
